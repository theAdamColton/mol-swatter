## How to Use Scraper

- It is a good idea to first make a new virtual env using conda or any other method

- Install requirements; from this dir ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

- The scraper's default behavior is to start scraping from a starting molar mass of 1. You may pass a single argument to the script to change the starting mass. Ex: ```python scraper.py 100```

- The logger will leave logging files in logging/ by default.
